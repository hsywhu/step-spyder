### Introdunction

---
This is a simple script for crawling the web data from our experiment system.

With it's help, you can easily obtain the experiment's steps rather than spending time typing those texts by yourself.

### How To Use

You need to let the program know the contents of your experiment. So you have to create a new file named **input.txt** and copy the Html code into it.

After that, you just need to run the program and the result will be saved into a newfile whose name is **output.txt**
